first create a table to display all posts, also the table has a select field to updat post status  

make a query to fetch all posts each with its columns
$query = "SELECT * FROM posts ";
loop through all the columns asigne the values to variables
echo each post columns value in the table
Note: category column has to be equal to its post so we make a conditional statement to get the category for this specific post
