at navigation, post has two options viewallposts and add_post. inside those links we direct the user 
e.g:  <a href="./posts.php?source=add_post">Add Posts</a>  
notice the link contains the source variable equal to one of the cases 

here by switch statement to check the what user want 
use $_GET to take what users enter, use one variable to show different pages 
this $source: is made to be make various functionality with post edit, delete, or viewallpost
so $_GET['$source'] has what user entered
case 'add_post';
    include "includes/add_post.php";
or 
case 'edit_post';
   include "includes/edit_post.php";
or the default which will be viewallposts
