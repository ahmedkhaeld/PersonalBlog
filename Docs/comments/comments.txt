from navigation bar when admin press on comment it process the comments.php page 
which sends admin to viewallcomments

IMPORTANT
post.php contains the form to submit a comment from the user to specific post.php
so 
make a query to insert 4 values into comments table (post id & post author & post email & post content) 
now in comment_post_id has post_id
